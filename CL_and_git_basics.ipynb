    "*After this lesson, you will be able to:*\n",
    "- Practice Python in the JupyterHub environment.\n",
    "- Interact with your JupyterHub server as well as person machine via the Command Line Interface (Terminal)\n",
    "- Explain the uses of Git and GitHub\n",
    "- Utilize Git and GitHub as a means of 'Version Control' (work saving)\n",
    "- Utilize Slack application for communication\n",

    "### STUDENT PRE-WORK\n",

    "- Set up and Log into Slack.\n",

    "    - The Command Line is a means of interacting with your computer with commands as opposed to clicking on things with your mouse.\n",

    "    - Git allows us to save entire folders and file systems and revert them to previous stages.  \n",
    "    \n",
    "- **GitHub**\n",
    "    - GitHub is a public application for saving and hosting your folders remotely that uses the Git langauage.\n",
    "    - Think of it as somewhat of a Google Drive for programming. (In that its a cloud service, not that its associated with your email.)\n",

    "    - Skype, but for Business and free.\n",
    "    - Still just as reasource unfriendly.  \n",
